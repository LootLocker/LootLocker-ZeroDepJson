# ZeroDepJson
A .NET JSON serializer/deserializer with zero dependencies.

There are already many JSON serializers available on the .NET platform. So why ZeroDepJson?

Here is why:

* It's is only one .cs file so it's super easy to integrate in any .NET project, .NET Framework, .NET core, .NET 5, client, server, etc.
* It supports .NET framework 4.0 to .NET 5 projects.
* You can change some parts of the code easily if you want to really customize it.
* As the name implies, it has ZERO dependency on anything except "a" .NET platform.
* It's quite feature full, more than some framework available today.



Just to make it clear, raw performance is not a goal. Although its performance is, I hope, decent, if you're after the best performing JSON serializer / deserializer, than don't use this.
